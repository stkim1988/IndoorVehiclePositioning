# External Vehicle Positioning System using Multiple Fish-eye Surveillance Cameras for Indoor Parking Lots,
Submitted for publication in IEEE Systems Journal

### Abstract
---

The vehicle's automatic positioning relies primarily on the Global Positioning System (GPS). However, in indoor environments such as tunnels and indoor parking lots, the GPS signal is weak, which can significantly reduce the accuracy of GPS-based positioning. To replace GPS signal in indoor spaces, we develop an accurate indoor vehicle positioning system using multiple fish-eye surveillance cameras. Our system first extracts vehicle segments from the top-view image of each fish-eye camera. These segments are then integrated into a common undistorted coordinate system. The center of the vehicle is finally determined using our simple but effective box fitting method. Moreover, a 1/18 scale indoor parking lot is designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. Throughout our experiments, we obtained average positioning errors of 30 cm or 24 cm in the regions covered by a single camera or multiple cameras, respectively.
